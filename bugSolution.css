Instead of relying solely on percentages within `calc()`, consider using viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) for dimensions relative to the browser window or explicitly setting dimensions based on known parent sizes or using JavaScript to dynamically calculate values.  Here's an example using `vw`:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#element {
  width: calc(50vw - 10px);
}
```
This approach ensures that the calculation is based on a consistent reference (the viewport width) regardless of the parent element's dimensions.
