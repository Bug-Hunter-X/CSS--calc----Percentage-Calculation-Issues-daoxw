The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, using it with percentages can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with nested elements or complex layouts. The issue arises from how the browser interprets and resolves percentage values within the calculation.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is dynamically determined or dependent on other factors.
